            <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research">Research</a></h3>
            <p align="justify">Our research focuses on a number of different areas of correlated electron phenomina, including molecular, solid-state and lattice problems. We see our techniques as resulting from a particularly fruitful blending of <em>ab initio</em> quantum chemistry and solid-state physics approaches, developing and applying techniques ranging from Monte Carlo, mean-field and machine learning, to Greens function methods. These are applied to understand and resolve unanswered questions about a wide variety of systems. See our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research">Research</a> page for more details on the developments in the group.</p>
            <p align="justify">We sincerly thank funding bodies for their support of this research: The Royal Society, Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the European Research Council.</p>

			<h3>Research Highlight</h3>
            <p align="justify">Often, parameterizing a system via an efficient, compact, and polynomially-complex wavefunctions is something which can be done with relative ease. However, when it comes to <em>optimizing</em> these parameters using the variational principle, we have no option but to resort to stochastic, Monte-Carlo techniques. This can be exceptionally difficult when you are relying on noisy estimates at each point. With a PhD student, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/group">Lauretta Schwarz</a>, we developed an improved approach, drawing on ideas from the supervised learning of neural networks, which is now published in Physical Review Letters entitled <em><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.176403">"Projector Quantum Monte Carlo Method for Nonlinear Wave Functions"</a></em>. </p>
            <p align="justify">Above shows the short-ranged anti-ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the ubiquitously prefixed 'wonder-material' Graphene, demonstrating the strength of the new approach</p>
