We have a new paper out in JCTC, detailing a novel stochastic approach to directly calculate response properties of molecular systems in a way that is systematically improvable to the exact solution. (See it <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03914'>here</a>). While solving the Schrodinger equation for the ground state energy is important, experimentalists are generally more interested in the response of a system after you hit it with something - I mean this is what an experiment is after all, right?!
