    Research in the Booth group focuses on <strong>developing</strong>, <strong>implementing</strong> and <strong>applying</strong> new computational techniques for the study of many-body physics and chemistry -- specifically trying to understand <em>correlated electron systems</em>. Being able to computationally predict the nature of these systems, their properties and responses to things like light, voltages, temperature and environmental changes, holds huge promise in a wide number of fields, from drug design to developing new materials, and where computers can answer questions about these materials where experiments would have much more difficulty. Do <em>you</em> want to experimentally study the nature of hydrogen at the surface of the sun?!

So what is the challenge with this field? The interactions between electrons and nuclei provide the glue that binds together all materials and chemicals. The specifics of these interactions give rise to the vast array of different properties around us, ranging from metallic behaviour, to catalytic biomolecules or magnetic interactions. However, while it is now common to design large-scale engineering projects from buildings to planes with accurate computational simulation, it is curious that the techniques for microscopic simulations of the interactions of these most fundamental particules is still very much lacking.

As a particularly impressive example, this picture shows a small cube of ceramic material, which has the amazing ability to levitate above a magnet when sufficiently cooled.

    These systems range from small astrochemical molecules, to exotic condensed matter, and much more. But why is this important...?
