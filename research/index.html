            FCIQMC is a recently developed quantum Monte Carlo method (together with Ali Alavi) which shows much promise in the description of correlated systems. It is a stochastic projector Monte Carlo approach which is formulated in the second quantized space of Slater determinants. While this space is exponentially large, the gauge freedom to choose the specific representation allows for a sparse representation of the wavefunction to be found, and annihilation events can then efficiently suppress the manifestation of the 'Fermion sign problem'. Further development is continuing in a number of directions to expand the scope, accuracy and efficiency of the approach in order to apply it to a range of chemical, material and lattice problems. These include:

                We have been developing new approaches to optimize and stochastically sample certain classes of tensor network states which don't easily admit to an efficient deterministic approach. This allows for higher-dimensional networks to be considered, in a scalable approach. The approach combines ideas of projector Monte Carlo with the non-linear form of these Tensor Networks. Additionally, ideas from accelerated optimization techniques used to train neural networks render the approach scalable and robust. The above shows the spin correlation functions derived from this work of a two-dimensional, <em>ab initio</em> graphene sheet, published in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, <strong>118</strong> 176403 (2017). This work is applied to lattice models, as well as realistic, extended systems.</p>

 Continuing developments are investigating coupling of the optimization to the stochastic sampling of auxiliary indices and moving towards entangled 2D networks.

            <h3>Embedded Methods In The Description Of Extended Systems</h3>

Since two-point correlation functions decay (generally exponentially fast in insulators), we look for ways to exploit this locality to develop quantum embedding approaches. As opposed to more traditional embedding methods such as QM/MM, these approaches allow for quantum fluctuations between the embedded fragment and the environment, and therefore describing the desired <em>mixed</em> quantum state on the fragment. In the condensed matter community, <em>Dynamical Mean-field Theory</em> has been hugely successful in describing the qualitative features of Mott insulating behaviour. However, much of this physics can also be captured in a wavefunction approach known as <em>Density Matrix Embedding Theory</em> (DMET). </p>
                <p align="justify"> 
                    Our research in this area concerns a number of aspects to develop these approaches, both for <em>ab initio</em> and lattice models. We are combining the DMET methodology with an LDA bandstructure for realistic materials, and comparing to the successful, but more expensive LDA+DMFT approach in collaboration with <a href=https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/cedric.weber/index.html>Dr. Cedric Weber</a> and the <tt>ONETEP</tt> code. We are also looking into diagrammatic extensions to the DMET approach, including improved self-consistency conditions based on the self-energy to allow for genuine lattice correlations rather than symmetry-breaking.

            <h3>Spectral Functions and Theoretical Spectroscopy</h3>
            <p align="justify">
                Spectral functions define the dynamic response of a system to a perturbation, and are the key quantities in a wide range of theoretical spectroscopy, giving access to the entire excitation spectrum of a system. This makes these quantities often more demanding to compute, and with a poorer range of techniques to reliably compute them compared to static observables. Beyond their utility in spectroscopy, they are often also the key quantum variables in computational methods too -- especially the one-particle greens function.

            <p align="justify">
                We are developing new approaches to compute correlated spectral functions of systems, including stochastic techniques, and cavity approximations from statistical physics. In addition, these spectra are used to develop new approaches to multireference quantum chemistry, circumventing the need for high-rank density matrices to couple the active space to the dynamic correlation, and providing a fully screened description of the effective interactions. Above shows the bandstructure of the Hubbard model computed via a stochastic Krylov projection technique, described in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, <strong>115</strong>, 050603 (2015).

                Can we <em>infer</em> a fully correlated wavefunction, with only partial knowledge of the amplitudes at particular points? The domain of machine learning has expanded in recent years into a powerful approach for inference and interpolation of complex functions. In collaboration with <a href=http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/gc121>Prof. G&aacute;bor Cs&aacute;nyi</a>, we are investigating approaches of using Gaussian Processes to describe an extensive and complete wavefunction which can capture strong correlation effects.

                New generations of time-resolved spectroscopy and cold-atom experiments are pushing the capabilities of computational approaches to study wave packets out of equilibrium, and in response to sudden changes in potentials. Stochastic dynamics are being devised based on time-dependent variational principles to access longer time scales of correlated phenomena beyond the linear response regime.
